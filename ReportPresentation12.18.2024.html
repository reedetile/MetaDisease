# Introduction
For the past couple of weeks I have been working on the metadisease project (Now Ch. 2 of my dissertation)
Here, I would like to report on the work I've gotten done, as well as what potential next steps I'd like to take.

I will report on the following:
1. Some important background decisions
2. The necessary parameters for this model and their assigned values
3. The frequency dependent epidiomological model I have constructed
---

# Background
* Originally, we had envisioned this project as using a few fake species as caricatures of an ecological system.
* However, I have found it difficult to ground myself and think through this model while using fake species.
* For that reason, I have decided to instead use a real world system as a case study for this project.
* I have chosen to use the same system that Mark used in his 2020 Ecology Letters paper, which is similar to that
used by Johnson et al (2013). However, we use BD as our disease system instead of trematodes.
---

# The focal question

## How does beta-diversity of a metacommunity relate to disease risk (measured as landscape `\(R_0\)`)
---

# The Study System
* We will be using an SIS disease model for this project.
* We have to include all of the assumption of a dilution effect. These include
  1. Hosts differ in "quality"
  2. Higher quality hosts tend to occur in species poor communities
  3. Lower quality hosts tend to occur in more diverse communities
  4. Lower quality hosts regulate the abundance of high quality hosts, or reduce encounter rates between high quality
     hosts and pathogens.
* We make some additional assumptions
  1. Inherent in this is the idea communities are nested within one another
  2. The most abundant and ubiquitous species should be the best reservoir
---

# The study system (continued)
* We will use the same study system as Wilber et al (2020), which is also similar to that used by johnson et al (2013).
* This study system includes 6 focal species those are: 
  1. P. regilla
  2. A. boreas
  3. L. catesbeianus
  4. L. draytonii
  5. T. torosa
  6. T. granulosa
* Disease = BD
---

# The models
* For this simulation, we need to determine rate change equations for the number of Suscpetible individuals (S) and the
  number of infectious individuals (I)
* I have come up with the following equations based on Wilber et. al (2020) and Wilber et. al (2022)
--

`$$\frac{\Delta S_{i,p}}{\Delta t} = b_i * N_{p,i} - d_i * S_{i,p} - \beta_{i,j} * S_{p,i} * \frac{I_{p,j}}{N_{p,j}} + \phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*S_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*S_{q,i}} * \frac{A_p}{A_q}$$`

`$$\frac{\Delta I_{i,p}}{\Delta t} = \beta_{i,j} * S_{p,i} * \frac{I_{p,j}}{N_{p,j}} - (v_i*d_i)*I_{p,i} + \phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*I_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*I_{q,i} * \frac{A_P}{A_q}}$$`

--
Where
* `\(b_i * N_{p,i}\)` represents the number of susceptible individuals being born and `\(d_i * S_{i,p}\)` is the number of
  susceptible individuals dying
  + `\(b_i\)` is the birth rate
  + `\(d_i\)` is the death rate

--
* `\(\beta_{i,j} * S_{p,i} * \frac{I_{p,j}}{N_{p,j}}\)` is the force of infection in a frequency dependent system
  + `\(\beta_{i,j}\)` is the transmission coefficient between susceptible individuals of species i and infectious individuals
    of species j.
---

# The models (continued)
* For this simulation, we need to determine rate change equations for the number of Suscpetible individuals (S) and the
  number of infectious individuals (I)
* I have come up with the following equations based on Wilber et. al (2020) and Wilber et. al (2022)

`$$\frac{\Delta S_{i,p}}{\Delta t} = b_i * N_{p,i} - d_i * S_{i,p} - \beta_{i,j} * S_{p,i} * \frac{I_{p,j}}{N_{p,j}} + \phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*S_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*S_{q,i}} * \frac{A_p}{A_q}$$`

`$$\frac{\Delta I_{i,p}}{\Delta t} = \beta_{i,j} * S_{p,i} * \frac{I_{p,j}}{N_{p,j}} - (v_i*d_i)*I_{p,i} + \phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*I_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*I_{q,i} * \frac{A_P}{A_q}}$$`

* `\(\phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*S_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*S_{q,i}} * \frac{A_p}{A_q}\)` **and** `\(\phi_i * \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{-c_{q,p}*I_{p,i} + c_{q,p}*I_{q,i} * \frac{A_P}{A_q}}\)` determine the movement of susceptible and infectious
  individuals between patches
  + `\(\phi_i\)` is a dispersal parameter for species i.
  + `\(c_{q,p}\)` and `\(c_{p,q}\)` represent the connectivity between patch p and patch q.
  + `\(\frac{A_p}{A_q}\)` is the area relationship between patches p and q.
---

# Parameters for the model
* With these equations in mind we can identify a few key parameters we will need to provide values for.
* Those are
  + `\(b_i\)` birth rate for each species
  + `\(d_i\)` death rate for each species
  + `\(v_i\)` recovery rate for each species
  + `\(beta_{i,j}\)` transmision coefficients *between each species*
  + `\(\phi_i\)` dispersal rates for each species
  + `\(c_{q,p}\)` connectivity between each pair of patches
  + `\(A\)` the area of each patch
---

# Reduce parameters
* The first step is to make my life easier by reducing the number of parameters
* For right now, we are examining a single season model, so it makes sense that `\(b_i\)` can be reduced the 0 for each species
* Additionally, we are uninterested in the affect of size for the time being, so if we assume all patches are of equal
  size, we can set `\(\frac{A_p}{A_q} = 1\)`
---

# Lit review and filling in the blanks
* To provide values for each parameter, I conducted a literature review to find at least approximate values for each 
  species
* However, these are quite a few parameters, and there may be differences in how studies measured them, if any such 
  studies exist.
* That is to say the following:
  + Where parameter estimates could be found, they are converted to a per day rate so that they could be applied to a 
    90 day amphibian breeding season
  + Where parameter estimates for a given species could not be found, I have pseudo-randomly assigned parameter values, 
    but these assignments are based on ecologically relevant information.
---

# A quick note on rank abundance

* I won't discuss it much here, but it's worth noting that I have begun simulating rank abundance of each of these
  species within a community. To do this, I largely referenced Johnson et al (2013)
* Where certain parameters have not been estimated in available literature, I largely used rank abundance of each species
  to determine where the parameters likely lie.

# Dispersal
* Dispersal is probably the hardest thing to measure
* Everything is in meters, kilometers... but we need to think in probability of moving from one patch to another
* I have a *potential* solution. (**potential** so please let me know your thoughts)
  + What if we used *colonization* to approximate dispersal?
  + My thought: the probability of colonization could be thought of as the product of a dispersal rate and the population
    size
  + The higher the population or the higher the dispersal rate, the higher `\(\gamma\)` is/ So we could think the following
  
  `$$\gamma = N * \phi$$`
  `$$\frac{\gamma}{N} = \phi$$`
  
  + where N = population size.
  + Additionally, in cases where we can't find a colonization rate, we *could* assume that `\(\gamma\)` is proportional
    to `\(\Psi\)` and use a similar equation.

# Next Steps

* So this is where I'm currently at.
* I have a couple important next goals
  1. I want to calculate landscape `\(R_0\)` for the metacommunity at each time step. Then, at each time step I can compare
     `\(\beta\)` diversity and `\(R_0\)` to determine any effects
  2. Although I haven't talked much about the creation of the metacommunity model, I would to start working off of more
     than 1 example metacommunity. What do I mean? I mean having a list of multiple (100s, 1000s?) simulated         
     metacommunities and the running this time simulation.
     
* Example

Metacommunity | `\(\beta\)` | `\(R_0\)`
--------------|---------|------
1             |0.75     | 0.9
2             |0.5      | 1.0
...           |         |
100           |0.25     | 1.1 
---

# Conclusion

* I have a working frequency dependent model
* I have values for each parameter that are based on real world values
* I need to figure out how to calculate `\(R_0\)` at each time step
* I want to run this simulation over multiple metacommunities
